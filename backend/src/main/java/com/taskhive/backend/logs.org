TODO:
_____

1) if you are logged in already, you cant access login/register page.

2) if you send login/regster request from already login system, send back an error.

3) /error page sent by the backend is currently authenticated, fix the Access Denied Exception

4) When we create a project invite, it is not immediately added to 'my projects'. Before seing after sending the rest api request, if successful, also manually add the new project to the projects array that is being displayed.

5) Try to handle other errors(if there are any) with popus

6) implement have i been pawned

7) while logging in, only three attempts should be given for a particular username




8) Display the users in the project,

9) Feature to assign tasks

10) Features to track the status of the tasks



* LOGS:

1) separated /getProjectById to /getOwnedProjectById and /getInvitedProjectById because to verify whether the project is an invite, we also need to verify the inbox id
